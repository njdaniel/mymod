# Mount and Blade Warband Large Shield Penalty on Horseback

## Ideas:

- Prevent all large infantry shields to be used on horseback. Although technically they could it is very awkward and not reccommended. For gameplay this would even out cavalry vs infantry. Current cavalry troops with large shields would be switched with a smaller cavalry version or have the large shield to protect back and to be better served when dismounted. In Bannerlord all the elite cavalry have large shields and there is really no downside for player or companions doing the same. With more elite cavalry units with smaller shields this gives infantry a larger role in the game especially in sieges. This would be the most simple to do, as there already a item flag that prevents the use on horseback in m&bw but for bannerlord there was none.

- Another thought is to have a penalty for the large shield on horseback. Such as reduce speed_rating or thrust_speed(overall the delay for blocking). But the penalty would have to be quite steep to make it worth ditching the large shield. 

- Ideally all things can be attempted and tried but have penalties that encourge using the best tool for the job. For example the large shields or longbows. Longbows could be on horseback and in Japan there was some evidance that this might have happened but nonetheless it is more convenient with a smaller bow. The biggest gripe I have with the large shields on horseback would be the clipping, the large shields go right through the horse, very annoying. Simply have the shields collide with the horse would show the advantages of the smaller shield on horseback. But I could see how that would programmically be more difficult for me. As I have pretty much no experience with animation or collision.


Although I have started with the 2nd option I would conclude that perhaps the first might be best for gameplay and balance and the most easy option. All of the shields (hopefully have a tag of large shield to differentiate other shileds) get the flag "cant_use_on_horseback" And go through the cav units and change the shields to something more appropriate.
